# Project 1: MLP Implementation


```diff
- Change branch to "correctbranch" to see project!
```
<i>The files have a lot of problem description, so the files are not located in the default branch to hopefully prevent my code from being searchable.</i>

The Jupyter notebook was provided with the code filled in. See <b>neural_net.py</b> for my code.

This is a multiperceptron implementation (2-layer neural Net with Softmax classifier) project for a Deep Learning class at Korea University.
